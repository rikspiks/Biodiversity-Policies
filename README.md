# Biodiversity Policies
## Overview
Using the Policy Database from Wuepper (2024)1, I extracted the policies that dealt with biodiversity. Since nearly all biodiversity policies where legislative, the goal was to find more aspects to characterize these policies. To do so, I first performed a Text Clustering based on word abundances in the provided abstracts of the policies. 
Then, on clearly distinguishable cluster, a group of policies dealing with environmental protection was selected, to perform a more guided clustering, to assign a goal, an instrument and an affected group to the policies.
The Clustering Processes are described in the Jupyter Notebooks

## Limitations and further Remarks
Some abstracts where not provided in a suffient matter, there wer empty or only contained a sentence, which was not sufficient for the analysis. Further since the translation to english was done using deepl pro, translating at least from spanish and french to english, there might still appear non-english phrases in the english abstracts.
